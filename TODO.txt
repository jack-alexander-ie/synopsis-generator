TODO:

- Add multiple character support (can't do Spanish and Danish at the same time currently)
- Change background color to darker color to match
- Check file validity
- Add usage support
- Add a UI
- Report packages not installed
- Make this a master image generator
- Renaming of some global variables
- Round image edges
- Add font size support to DB
- Remove functions from constructors - not good for inheritance!

- Currently, script pulls all values from the excel file and stores in memory.
  This is fine for a small number of titles, but with a large number of titles, memory would be quickly eaten

- Add support for:

    Albums covers
    Magazine covers
    Shopping
